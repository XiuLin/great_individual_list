Record those characters who touched you and me.

They may be nameless and silent in the river of history, they may be ordinary individuals around us, but in a single moment, they touch our hearts. Here, I hope they can be recorded. Even though we walk through the world like ants, preserving the beauty in our hearts will provide us with the last sanctuary amidst the impurities. For those who carry the firewood for others, we must not let them freeze in the wind and snow. For those who seek the welfare of the masses, we must not let them fight alone. For those who pave the way for freedom, we must not let them be trapped in thorns.

他们可能寂寂无名，他们可能默于历史长河，他们可能只是我们身边普普通通的小人物，但是总一个瞬间他们感动了你我。在这里我希望能他们被记录下来，虽然你我都如蝼蚁般行走在人世间，保留心底的美好会给身处污浊的我们保留最后一片净土。为众人抱薪者，不可使其冻毙于风雪；为大众谋福利者，不可使其孤军奋战；为自由开路者，不可使其困顿于荆棘。
